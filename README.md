# ShopClosureBindingApp

ShopClosureBindingApp is a sample iOS project built with **Swift** and **UIKit**, following the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture.  
The app consumes a **REST API** to fetch and display product data, featuring both a **product list screen** and a **product detail screen**.
